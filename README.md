# SQL-Tunnel


## Description
A [Python template](https://github.com/jeffgladstone/SQL-Tunnel/blob/master/sql_tunnel.py) designed to manipulate a database file using SQL queries. It then outputs the result set to a CSV file.

## Purpose
To directly work with .db and .csv files without having to use Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) such as SQLite or MySQL.
Allows user to run SQL queries through Python and output coherent result sets in CSV without difficulty.
